# socket.io emulator

This is a socket.io emulation on the browser side only.
The goal is to reuse client/server code i got.

# TODO
* make the server run in a worker...
  * thus serverinbrowser is no more slower than the serverinserver

------------------------------------------------------

* only a single connection
  * dont over engineer it
* be compatible with socket.io apion client and server
* how to test it ?
  * outside of pacmaze itself
  * should i make a separate node-socketio-emu ?
    * why not after all
    * would help make it cleaner
* socketio
